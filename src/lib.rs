//! # CD-DA (audio CD) reading library
//!
//! This library provides cross-platform audio CD reading capabilities
//! (tested on Windows, macOS and Linux). It was written to enable CD ripping,
//! but you can also implement a live audio CD player with its help.
//! The library works through platform CD-drive APIs on macOS and issuing direct
//! SCSI commands on Windows and Linux and abstracts both access to the CD drive
//! and reading the actual data from it, so you don't deal with the hardware directly.
//!
//! All operations happen in this order:
//!
//! 1. Get a CD drive's handle
//! 2. Read the ToC (table of contents) of the audio CD
//! 3. Read track data using ranges from the ToC
//!
//! ## CD access
//!
//! The easiest way to open a drive is to use [`CdReader::open_default`], which scans
//! all drives and opens the first one that contains an audio CD:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cd_da_reader::CdReader;
//!
//! let reader = CdReader::open_default()?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! If you need to pick a specific drive, use [`CdReader::list_drives`] followed
//! by calling [`CdReader::open`] with the specific drive:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cd_da_reader::CdReader;
//!
//! // Windows / Linux: enumerate drives and inspect the has_audio_cd field
//! let drives = CdReader::list_drives()?;
//!
//! // Any platform: open a known path directly
//! // Windows:  r"\\.\E:"
//! // macOS:    "disk6"
//! // Linux:    "/dev/sr0"
//! let reader = CdReader::open("disk6")?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! ## Reading ToC
//!
//! Each audio CD carries a Table of Contents with the block address of every
//! track. You need to read it first before issuing any track read commands:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cd_da_reader::CdReader;
//!
//! let reader = CdReader::open_default()?;
//! let toc = reader.read_toc()?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! The returned [`Toc`] contains a [`Vec<Track>`](Track) where each entry has
//! two equivalent address fields:
//!
//! - **`start_lba`** -- Logical Block Address, which is a sector index.
//!   LBA 0 is the first readable sector after the 2-second lead-in pre-gap.
//!   This is the format used internally for read commands.
//! - **`start_msf`** — Minutes/Seconds/Frames, a time-based address inherited
//!   from the physical disc layout. A "frame" is one sector; the spec defines
//!   75 frames per second. MSF includes a fixed 2-second (150-frame) lead-in
//!   offset, so `(0, 2, 0)` corresponds to LBA 0. You can convert between them easily:
//!   `LBA + 150 = total frames`, then divide by 75 and 60 for M/S/F.
//!
//! ## Reading tracks
//!
//! Pass the [`Toc`] and a track number to [`CdReader::read_track`]. The
//! library calculates the sector boundaries automatically. On CD-Extra discs
//! where the last audio track is followed only by data tracks, the trailing
//! audio/data session gap is excluded from the audio read.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cd_da_reader::CdReader;
//!
//! let reader = CdReader::open_default()?;
//! let toc = reader.read_toc()?;
//! let data = reader.read_track(&toc, 1)?; // we assume track #1 exists and is audio
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! This is a blocking call. For a live-playback or progress-reporting use case,
//! use the streaming API instead:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cd_da_reader::{CdReader, RetryConfig, TrackStreamConfig};
//!
//! let reader = CdReader::open_default()?;
//! let toc = reader.read_toc()?;
//!
//! let cfg = TrackStreamConfig {
//!     sectors_per_chunk: 27, // ~64 KB per chunk
//!     retry: RetryConfig::default(),
//! };
//!
//! let mut stream = reader.open_track_stream(&toc, 1, cfg)?;
//! while let Some(chunk) = stream.next_chunk()? {
//!     // process chunk — raw PCM, 2 352 bytes per sector
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! ## Track format
//!
//! Track data is raw [PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation),
//! the same format used inside WAV files. Audio CDs use 16-bit stereo PCM
//! sampled at 44 100 Hz:
//!
//! ```text
//! 44 100 samples * 2 channels * 2 bytes = 176 400 bytes/second
//! ```
//!
//! Each sector holds exactly 2 352 bytes (176 400 ÷ 75 = 2 352), that's where
//! 75 sectors per second comes from. A typical 3-minute track is
//! ~31 MB; a full 74-minute CD is ~650 MB.
//!
//! Converting raw PCM to a playable WAV file only requires prepending a 44-byte
//! RIFF header — [`CdReader::create_wav`] does exactly that:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cd_da_reader::CdReader;
//!
//! let reader = CdReader::open_default()?;
//! let toc = reader.read_toc()?;
//! let data = reader.read_track(&toc, 1)?;
//! let wav = CdReader::create_wav(data);
//! std::fs::write("track01.wav", wav)?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! ## Metadata
//!
//! Audio CDs carry almost no semantic metadata. [CD-TEXT] exists but is
//! unreliable and because of that is not provided by this lbirary. The practical approach is to
//! calculate a Disc ID from the ToC and look it up on a service such as
//! [MusicBrainz]. The [`Toc`] struct exposes everything required for the
//! [MusicBrainz disc ID algorithm].
